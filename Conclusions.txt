We can conclude from the data that:
	The major percentage of total fare are in urban cities.
	Also, the major percentage of total rides are in urban cities.
	Finally, the major percentage of drivers are from urban cities.

In the other hand, we can see a correlation between total fare and number of rides between different type of cities. 
If it's a rural zone it trends to be a more expensive ride than to a urban zone. Also, the rides from suburban trends to
be in the average of fare between rural and urban rides.
